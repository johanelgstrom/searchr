# Searchr - Thesis for the Front end Development course at Medieinstitutet Stockholm, 2021-2023.

Searchr is a web application which helps you search for missing people, pets and objects. The entire thought behind it is for the community to come together as one to help and search. 
As a user you could create a post with a description, picture and starting location for the search. Other user could then see the post and where to search. Anyone with an account could join in to search and with the help of a map see where other people have searched already. 

## Before you clone the project

A couple of things have not been pushed up here for security and size reasons, which is the following:
- .env (in the backend folder), which includes CONNECTION_STRING to a mongoDB database and JWT_SECRET for encyrpting sensitive login data.
- public (in the backend folder), which includes an images folder where images of posts gets stored

## To start the project
- Backend starts with opening a terminal in the backend folder and run "nodemon"
- Frontend starts with opening a terminal in the root and run "npm start"
